# ciaplist

The project of a simple shopping list in which any user logged in to a particular account can see and modify the list. We came up with this idea during #lockdown, when we could not find any app with such list that would satisfy us. We decided to create one of our own.
Technologies used in the project: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python(Django);
authors: agatakk (design and frontend), cmaiek (backend);
