# ciaplist

The project of a simple shopping list, in which any user logged in to a particular account, can see and modify the list. We came up with this idea during the #lockdown, when we could not find any app with a list that would satisfy us. We decided to create one of our own.

Technologies used in the project: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python(Django);
authors: agatakk (design and frontend), cmaiek (backend);

Live version has been uploaded to herokuapp.com

At the moment we are at the process of learning how to build the list using API, so that it is more efficient.
